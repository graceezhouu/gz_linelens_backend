# Design Document for QueueStatus

For `QueueStatus`, no major changes were added since Assigment 2. 

I believe the design already emphasizes **separation of concerns**, **independence**, and **reusability**. 

The actions for `QueueStatus` perform the following: 
- Create a new queue record.
- Updates queue metrics.
- Returns the current state.


Specific details wise, 
- Based on feedback from Assigment 2, the location parameter has been specified to be a geocoordinate. The display of the actions section has been made more clear visually. 
- Actions section has been reformatted. 
- Since only minor edits were made in this section, AI was **not** used to create / enhance the specification. Everything was written manually.
