# Design Document for QueueStatus

For `QueueStatus`, no major changes were added since Assigment 2.

I believe the design already emphasizes **separation of concerns**, **independence**, and **reusability**.

The actions for `QueueStatus` perform the following:

* Create a new queue record.
* Updates queue metrics.
* Returns the current state.

Specific details wise,

* Based on feedback from Assigment 2, the location parameter has been specified to be a geocoordinate. The display of the actions section has been made more clear visually.
* Actions section has been reformatted.
* Since only minor edits were made in this section, AI was **not** used to create / enhance the specification. Everything was written manually.
