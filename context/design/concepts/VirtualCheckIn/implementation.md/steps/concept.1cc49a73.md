# concept: VirtualCheckIn

**purpose** Enable users to reserve a place in line remotely for supported events.

**principle** If a user checks into a queue at a desired time, they will receive an arrival window, minimizing physical waiting and coordinating their arrival. If they do not arrive within their window, their reservation will expire.
