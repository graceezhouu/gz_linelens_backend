# concept: Prediction [Location, User]

**purpose** provide users with estimated wait times and entry likelihoods for specific locations, leveraging both historical trends and real-time user-contributed data.

**principle** if users at a location submit reports about their current experience (e.g., wait time, crowd level), then the system will quickly update its forecasts for that location, combining these live inputs with historical trends, making the predictions more accurate and useful for all interested users. For example, if historical data suggests a 30-minute wait at a popular coffee shop, but several live users report "no wait" or "empty", the system should adjust the predicted wait time downwards significantly.

**state**
  // Stores baseline historical data for wait times and entry likelihoods for specific time slots
  a set of HistoricalRecords with
    a location Location
    a dayOfWeek Number // 0-6 for Sunday-Saturday
    a hourOfDay Number // 0-23
    an avgWaitTime Number // in minutes
    an entryLikelihood Number // 0.0 - 1.0

  // Stores live user-submitted reports about current conditions at locations
  a set of UserReports with
    a user User
    a location Location
    a reportedWaitTime Number? // optional, in minutes
    a reportedCrowdLevel String? // optional, e.g., "Empty", "Moderate", "Busy", "Packed"
    a timestamp Number // Unix timestamp in ms

  // Stores the calculated, current predictions for each location
  a set of CurrentPredictions with
    a location Location
    a predictedWaitTime Number // in minutes
    a predictedEntryLikelihood Number // 0.0 - 1.0
    a lastUpdated Number // Unix timestamp in ms

**actions**

  // Allows a user to submit their current experience at a location
  submitReport (user: User, location: Location, reportedWaitTime?: Number, reportedCrowdLevel?: String): Empty | (error: String)
    requires reportedWaitTime is present OR reportedCrowdLevel is present
    effects
      create a new UserReport associating user, location, provided data, and current timestamp
      trigger updatePrediction for this location

  // Adds or updates a piece of historical data. This is typically for admin/setup.
  seedHistoricalData (location: Location, dayOfWeek: Number, hourOfDay: Number, avgWaitTime: Number, entryLikelihood: Number): Empty | (error: String)
    requires dayOfWeek is between 0 and 6 (inclusive), hourOfDay is between 0 and 23 (inclusive), avgWaitTime >= 0, entryLikelihood >= 0 and <= 1
    effects
      if a HistoricalRecord for location, dayOfWeek, hourOfDay exists, update its avgWaitTime and entryLikelihood
      else create a new HistoricalRecord

  // System action: Recalculates and updates predictions for a specific location based on historical and live data.
  system updatePrediction (location: Location): Empty
    requires true // This action can always be triggered
    effects
      retrieve relevant historical data for the location and current time slot
      retrieve recent (e.g., last 30 minutes) user reports for the location
      calculate new predictedWaitTime and predictedEntryLikelihood by combining historical data and live reports
      update or create the CurrentPrediction for the location with the new values and current timestamp

  // System action: Cleans up old user reports to maintain data relevance.
  system cleanOldReports (): Empty
    requires true // This action can always be triggered
    effects delete UserReports older than a certain threshold (e.g., 2 hours)

**queries**

  // Retrieves the current prediction for a given location.
  _getPrediction (location: Location): (predictedWaitTime: Number, predictedEntryLikelihood: Number)
    effects return the predictedWaitTime and predictedEntryLikelihood from CurrentPredictions for the given location, or reasonable defaults if no prediction exists.

  // Retrieves raw user reports for a given location (for debugging or admin purposes).
  _getRawReports (location: Location): (reports: UserReport[])
    effects return an array of recent UserReports for the specified location.
